Hello and Welcome to Face The Apex

The ideia of creating this site is primarly to have fun. Me and my friend Marcos already tried creating a site in the past but we soon lost the will to continue. So, this is our second attempt.
However, this time we have something different in mind. We wanna try to choose just one of our passions: sim racing. And use the site as a way to collect and keep track of all our knowledge and share with anyone who enjoys the same.
We are Brazilians, so, try to keep a site in English is a plus challenge, not just on trying to have a bigger audience but to stick to the use of the language and to act as somekind of portfolio.
